# A Python Program / Project

**This is a Python project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the sixth semester class Multimedia Systems
and is one of the final projects for the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A series of Python scripts that implement some multimedia compression functions and actions.
>

> #### Steps of project
>
> 1. Ρead the image and quantize the input panel using the quantization parameter
> 2. Εncode the number of repetitions of the quantized pixel table by first recording the location where a new color occurs and only recording when a new color appears
> 3. Οrganize the resulting structure and store it effectively
> 4. Reading a video sequence
> 5. Calculation of the different sequential frames, pixel by pixel
> 6. The differences have a lower entropy - quantization of the values as determined by the value of the quantization parameter given at the input
> 7. As an input you should be able to accept any character sequence
> 8. You should be able to set the dictionary size as an input Assume a maximum size of 256 (8-bytes)
> 9. At the output should be a list of indexes corresponding to the input string taking into account the dictionary-index word pairs.
> 10. Give the output a number that expresses the compression ratio

> #### About this project
>
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the .py archive
> - This project was written in IDLE, Python’s Integrated Development and Learning Environment.
> - This program runs for Python version 2.7
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
